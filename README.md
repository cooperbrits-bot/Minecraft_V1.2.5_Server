## Minecraft V1.2.5 private server ##
EDIT:Hey so to actually have other people join use Radmin VPN 
i've put it there for you then once its setup click: "network"  
then: "Create network" then make a network and make a password 
then BOOM under Desktop or what ever you have your laptop/PC 
named as you'll see something like this eg: 26.157.52.193
then your friends use that as a address on minecraft and now PLAY!

DM me on discord for help: Kiyoshi_brits
